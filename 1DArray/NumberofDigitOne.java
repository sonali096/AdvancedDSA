/*The brute force solution of traversing all numbers from 1 to A and counting the number of 1s in each number will not pass with the given constraints.

Try to approach the problem in a different way.

Let’s just figure out the number of 1s at one’s place, a number of 1s in second place, and so on. We will add all these occurrences of 1s.

At one’s place:
up to 10, there is 1 one.
up to 20, there are 2 one’s.
.
.
up to 131, there are 14 one’s
up to 13x(x>1), there are 14 one’s.

Number of 1’s at one’s position = (n/10) + (n%10!=0)

Try to find the formula for ten’s place, hundred’s place, and so on.

Solution can be summarised into 4 steps:
1) Initialize ans = 0
2) Iterate over i from 1 to n incrementing by 10 times in each iteration.
3) Add (n / (i * 10 ) ) * i to ans after each (i * 10) interval.
4) Add min( max((n mod (i * 10) – i + 1, 0), i) to ans. */

/*Problem Description
Given an integer A, find and return the total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to A.



Problem Constraints
0 <= A <= 109



Input Format
The only argument given is the integer A.



Output Format
Return the total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to A.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = 10
Input 2:

 A = 11


Example Output
Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 4


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

Digit 1 appears in 1 and 10 only and appears one time in each. So the answer is 2.
Explanation 2:

Digit 1 appears in 1(1 time) , 10(1 time) and 11(2 times) only. So the answer is 4. */
